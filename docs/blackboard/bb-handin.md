# Hand-In

When the time comes, you need to go through the submission process of Blackboard, you head to 'Hand-in' and there you can submit all the files relevant for the deadline. 
The page on Blackboard will always have the ‘Dresscode’ file on top, if needed by students for reference.

Click the assignment that you will be submitting (in this ex the one below ‘Dresscode Disclaimer’), the page should look like this:

Then select the file of the project you’ve been working on. Keep in mind, only the listed file types will be accepted, because of the plagiarism bot, otherwise it will be considered as a “MO” (Missed Opportunity) and you won’t get graded on it.

Make sure to carefully read the “Assignment Information” as it contains relevant information, such as if you can/need to submit a .zip file or other file type, if it doesn’t specify that, then just refer to the list under the ‘Attach Files’ section.

##Submitting

Once you finish with that page, hit 'Submit' (to deliver the assignment) or 'Save Draft' (to just have it on your Blackboard for later).

You can always return to that page to edit your submission inside the deadline period, meaning if you're ahead of time and want to edit something, you can, afterwards just click ‘Submit’ again and the latest edit will take the spot. You're allowed to do that as many times as you need/want, again, as long as it's inside the deadline period, since the page will stop working after the Deadline is passed.

If you miss a oportunity window, sometimes you can try talking to your teacher to submit by other means, but those rights are usually  only granted in cases of a problem with Hanze’s system that prevented you from submitting. 

Is of most importance that you are fully aware of the amount of time you have to submit something, as failing for MO can be very frustrating. But if it does happen there is always a second opportunity...

##Second Opportunities

Sometimes you might not pass a submission, either getting a low grade or a MO for any reason. Doesn’t mean you failed, yet, because all projects have a resit or ‘Second Opportunity’.

If you do end up having to make use of it, it will automatically appear on the Hand in page (either under or above the first opportunity link), if it doesn’t appear make sure to contact your teacher of the subject, to avoid any last minute panics.

If you still fail the second opportunity you have two choices:

A. Attempt the course again next year, you’ll be placed in a class for the course, assuming that you manage to pass the year (more detail on this will follow).

B. Try and appeal for a third opportunity, but those are only granted in rare cases, you need to have a REALLY good reason for not being able to win that case, e.g. If a health issue got in the way, a loved one passed or a pandemic hit. 

##Resiting a previous year course

If you failed a year 1 course (for example), but still end the year with 45 points or above, you can attempt it again in year 2. What will happen is that you’ll be placed in a year 1 class just for that course specifically, in order to try and pass it this time.

Failed again? You can try again on the next one, and the next one, and the next one and so forth, but you cannot graduate if you don’t pass all the courses of each year of your study.
