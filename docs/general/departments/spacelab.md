# Spacelab


Under the Makerspace wing of creative areas, this is the place dedicated to all things VR and AR. Works simillar to Makerspace, even shares the same assistants, with a more focus on VR/AR inquiries. There is always a Makerspace assistant on site to help you out. You can came bewteen the opening hours to test you project, ask questions or just use VR for a while, do keep in mind a "first come first served" applies here, and of course someone comming to look for help or test a project has preference to someone just comming to play VR.
