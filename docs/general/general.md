HanzeGuru is a centralized place to find all kinds of information about Groningen and Hanze University of Applied Sciences. It is updated and maintained by Students for Students.

All information on this site are either provided by students of Hanze UAS or gathered from the [hanze.nl](https://hanze.nl/) website to be displayed easier and in a much more accessible way.

If you are a student and would like to contribute to this project you can do so by helping out on [Github](https://github.com/zerenxyz/hanzeguru)! You can also join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XenYeQShC6) server for questions on how to help out or point out mistakes if needed.
