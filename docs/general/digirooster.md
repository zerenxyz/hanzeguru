All courses, classes and schools have their own code for Digirooster, even teachers, if you need to know the schedule of one. You get all the relevant codes to you through email,  Hanze will send it out to you close to the start of the year, via Outlook.

Once you have them just look for them on the left corner and the entire schedule will be available to you, and even on your phone after you sync it.
