# Address Registration


If staying at Groningen for more than 4 months is part of your plan, then you'll need to register at the municipality. Firstly you'll need to make a appointment, either calling there or on their website, right here -> [Groningen Municipality website](https://gemeente.groningen.nl/student-registration-or-deregistration).

You need to have a address in the netherlands, not necessary in Groningen, to be resgitered at (where all your mail will go to).

Remember to bring some documents: Your birth certificate, ID (if from EU country) or passport (if non EU country)* and your residence contract agreement. And keep in mind if any of the documents (except ID/passport) in dutch or english, they need to be translated by a official in your country.
