# Dutch Banks

If you're going to live in the Ntherlands, you will need to own a Dutch bank account! Fortunately, there are plenty of options to choose from and all of them provide student accounts. You will find a list of some of the popular Dutch banks below, with links to their corresponding websites. 

Remember, you will need your BSN first before opening an account in any bank. [Click here](https://hanzeguru.nl/groningen/address-registration/) for more information on that.

## ABN AMRO

[ABN AMRO](https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/index.html) is a good option for international students as they provide their information in English and their student package is free! 

## ING

[ING](https://www.ing.nl/particulier/index.html) also allows opening a student account for free and their information is shared in both English and Dutch.

## Rabobank

[Rabobank](https://www.rabobank.com/en/home/index.html) is known for their highly rated safety measures internationally, and opening an account is free! Unfortunately, their websites and other services are only available in Dutch right now, but most people in the Netherlands speak English pretty well so their customer service quality will not be affected.

!!! tip
    Google Chrome usually automatically translates a webpage that is not primarily in English. If that does not happen and there is no visible option for an English version,     right-click on the page and select "Translate to English"!
