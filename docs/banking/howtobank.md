# How to Open A Dutch Bank Account

Living in the Netherlands means you will need a Dutch bank account to live easily and have access to more services. Additionally, your financial guarentee will only be returned to your new Dutch account, so opening one is crucial as a student. Thankfully, it's a pretty simple process!

!!! note
    You need to get your BSN before opening a bank account. Read more about that [here](../groningen/address-registration.md). 

### Choose A Bank
[Click here](./dutch-banks.md) to get to know some of the options, but it's important to do your own research, too!

### Make An Appointment

Most banks require an appointment to open an account, but there are some that accept walk-in's. Again, make sure to do proper research on the bank you want to go with. If you choose to go with Mobile Banking, then you need not worry about this step.

### Bring The Necessary Documents 

To open an account, they will, at the very least, ask for these:

1. BSN 
2. Passport/ID with visa
3. The acceptance letter from Hanze
4. The IND letter 

It's best to carry any other important documents you have to the bank as well, in case they ask for them. 

### Wait For Your Debit Card

If all goes well, your debit card should arrive by mail a few days later. There will be a seperate mail that contains the PIN for the card, which you will need to use it.

### And You're Done! 

If you have any troubles, contact the bank directly (either online, by calling them or by visitng them) to get the best solutions.
